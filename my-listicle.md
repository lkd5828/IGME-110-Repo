## Welcome to my Listicle!

Check it out:

### *Applications I always install on a fresh (Windows) computer!*
***!!IMPORTANT!!***\
I have not checked any of these websites without an Adblock. Traverse the web at your own risk!!

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/">Everything</a> </li>
  An alternative to the slow Windows File Explorer.
<li><a href="https://www.screentogif.com/">ScreenToGif</a> </li>
  A screen-recorder than natively uses .gif. Also a basic .gif editor.
<li><a href="https://deskpins.en.softonic.com/download?ex=RAMP-3507.0&rex=true">Deskpins</a> </li>
  It keeps whatever application you want on the 'top'.
<li><a href="https://www.getpaint.net/download.html">Paint.net</a> </li>
  A basic image editing tool, useful for making fast image edits.
<li><a href="https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu">Open-Shell</a> </li>
  It modifies the basic Start menu to be customizable.
<li><a href="https://krita.org/en/download/">Krita</a></li>
  This is just my art-program of choice- it's highly customizable.
<li><a href="https://www.blender.org/download/">Blender</a></li>
  An art-program I don't tend to use as often; it's great for animations.
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Notepad++</a></li>
  The best .txt editor, in my opinion; saves unsaved works, and easy to read.
<li><a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/download/">Audacity</a></li>
  A really high-end audio-editing software- easy for beginners, which is the level I'm perpetually at..
<li><a href="https://images.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC Media Player</a></li>
  This tends to work better than my default Windows 11 Media player.
<li><a href="https://www.bandicam.com/downloads/">Bandicam</a></li>
  Same as ScreenToGif, but for .mp4s- has a decent enough editor, also.

*Further notes about this listicle:*\
I've tried to limit it to 'non-obvious' downloads. Most people, for example, would have immediately downloaded\
a browser to begin with, for instance- to tack it on here is not really necessary for my purposes. I tried to keep\
the 'obscurity' level relative to its placement on the list: with the lowest being most well-known, and highest being\
some-what unknown.\

I hope you find this listicle interesting!
