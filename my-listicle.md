<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/">Everything</a> </li>
  An alternative to the slow Windows File Explorer.
<li><a href="https://www.screentogif.com/">ScreenToGif</a> </li>
  A screen-recorder than natively uses .gif. Also a basic .gif editor.
<li><a href="https://deskpins.en.softonic.com/download?ex=RAMP-3507.0&rex=true">Deskpins</a> </li>
  It keeps whatever application you want on the 'top'.
<li><a href="https://www.getpaint.net/download.html">Paint.net</a> </li>
  A basic image editing tool, useful for making fast image edits.
<li><a href="https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu">Open-Shell</a> </li>
  It modifies the basic Start menu to be customizable.
<li><a href="https://krita.org/en/download/"></a>Krita</li>
  This is just my art-program of choice- it's highly customizable.
<li><a href="https://www.blender.org/download/"></a>Blender</li>
  An art-program I don't tend to use as often; it's great for animations.
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/"></a>Notepad++</li>
  The best .txt editor, in my opinion; saves unsaved works, and easy to read.
<li><a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/download/"></a>Audacity</li>
  A really high-end audio-editing software- easy for beginners, which is the level I'm perpetually at..
<li><a href="https://images.videolan.org/vlc/"></a>VLC Media Player</li>
  This tends to work better than my default Windows 11 Media player.
<li><a href="https://www.bandicam.com/downloads/"></a>Bandicam</li>
  Same as ScreenToGif, but for .mp4s- has a decent enough editor, also.
